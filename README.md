# Download
The idler executable is included in the `/libs` directory of your SGI installation. Since it's already bundled with SGI and has limited standalone use, I won't be providing a separate release. However, the source code is available for those interested in exploring or building it from scratch.

# Build It Yourself
1. **Clone**: `git clone -b idler-csharp https://github.com/ProbablyRaging/steam-game-idler.git`
2. **Build**: `msbuild ./idler.csproj`
3. **Check console output** for build dir *(usually `/bin/dist`)*
