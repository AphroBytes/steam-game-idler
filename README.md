# Download
The idler executable is included with all versions of SGI and can be found in the `/libs` directory of your SGI installation. As it's already bundled with SGI I won't be providing a separate release for the idler since it has limited standalone utility. However, I'm making the source code available for those who are interested, or wanting to build it from scratch.

# Build It Yourself
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone -b idler-csharp https://github.com/ProbablyRaging/steam-game-idler.git
```
1. Build the executable
```
msbuild .\idler.csproj
```
3. Check the console output for build directory *(usually `/bin/dist`)*
